## Description
Goal: Create a dynamic form using a frontend framework and TypeScript. Render it based on a provided configuration array and capture user input.

Requirements:
Use hooks or equivalent, and a state management tool.
Configurations specify type (e.g., "text", "number", "select"), label, and options (for select types).
Include a submit button. On submission, display the captured data.
Ensure a mobile-first, responsive design.
Employ TypeScript for type definitions and checks

## Testing Online
This code can be tested from Stackblitz 
https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/paulrojas/stackblitz-torc-reactjs

Alternatively, the repository can be cloned from my git account:
https://github.com/paulrojas/stackblitz-torc-reactjs

I recommend using Stackblitz because it's faster to setup.

## Technical Specs

I decided to use Stackblitz and started a NextJs project that's configured to use Typescript and Tailwind

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
